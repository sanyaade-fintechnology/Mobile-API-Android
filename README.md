The PaylevenAppApi makes possible for app developers to open the payleven application from within their own apps and process payments. Although the payment is initiated on your app, it is the payleven application that takes care of handling the payment process. After a payment is processed, it will open your app and notify if the payment was successful, canceled or failed. 

#### Main Features
- Connects to payleven EMV/PCI certified card reader via bluetooth
- Accept all major card schemes such as Visa, Mastercard or American Express
- Provide immediate information about the payment status 
- Refund card payments
- Supports cash payment method
- Supports all main languages

#### Limitations
- Available only on the markets where [payleven](https://payleven.com/) operates
- Limited control on the UI 

#### Prerequisites
######Step 1 - Create a merchant account
To process a transaction you need to login in the payleven app with our payleven account. You can create an account by registering on our [webiste](https://payleven.co.uk/registration/?login=). Make sure to register for the country you wish.

######Step 2 - Create a developer account
To grant your application access to paylevenâ€™s API you need to [register](https://service.payleven.com/uk/developer/) and receive an API key. Please keep in mind that you should use your final app specifications (e.g bundle-ID for iOS or package name for Android) during the registration since these will be used in combination with your API key to identify of your app.

######Step 3 - Install the payleven app
Althought the payment is initiated in your app; the actual transaction takes place within the payleven app. For this reason, the payleven app must be installed on the mobile device you wish to use for accepting card payments.

######Step 4 - Purchase card reader
To accept card payments, you need to purchase a card reader. This is possible on our [website](https://payleven.co.uk/registration/?login=) during the registration or in your [payleven account](https://service.payleven.com/uk/ordermain) after registration. 
For testing purposes a card reader is not necessarily needed as the transaction flow can be tested using another payment methods: e.g. cash.

### Getting started
#### Setup your app
Use the API key received from payleven to setup your app. Before doing payments you need to configure the API. In the following example replace "yourApiKey".
```
PaylevenApi.configure(yourApiKey);
```

#### Start Payment
Below you see an example payment call to open the payleven app with an amount, a custom order ID, a description and a product picture.
```
TransactionRequestBuilder builder = new TransactionRequestBuilder(amount, currency);
                    .setDescription(description)
                    .setBitmap(image);
                    
TransactionRequest request = builder.createTransactionRequest()
                            
PaylevenApi.initiatePayment(MainActivity.this, orderId, request);
```

#### Open transaction history
To open the transaction history you have to call the openSalesHistory method. Below you see an example of the transaction history call to open the payleven App at the transaction history view.
```
PaylevenApi.openSalesHistory(MainActivity.this);
```

#### Open transaction details
To open the details view of a transaction you have to call the openTransactionDetails method and set the order ID of such transaction. Below you see an example of this call:
```
PaylevenApi.openTransactionDetails(MainActivity.this, orderId);
```

#### Refund transaction
It is also possible to refund a transaction. Calling the method openTransactionDetailsForRefund and providing an order ID will open a transaction details view with the option to refund the payment. Below you see an example of this call:
```
PaylevenApi.openTransactionDetailsForRefund(MainActivity.this, orderId);
```
